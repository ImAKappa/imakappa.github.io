## Securing Account Information

Do not reuse the same password across different accounts.

Use 2FA whenever possible, but make sure to store several copies of backup codes in case you lose your phone.

Do not log in to important accounts over public wifi, with or without a VPN. If you must, then use a paid VPN service.

Use several accounts with one password manager, or several password managers, but no more than three (anymore will be difficult to commit to the passwords to memory). Place account details such that you frequently use the password managers.
Keep important accounts distributed among password manager accounts (like banking and government stuff).
